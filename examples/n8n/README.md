# n8n integration examples

## digitax_invoice_intake.json

A sanitized export of the current DigiTax invoice-intake draft (mailbox
intake, invoice classification, OCR/LLM extraction via Gemini, K1/K2 master
data and VAT-ID matching, Reqeli analysis, TCMS-Framework and Excel
reporting). It is a credential-free reference for the existing workflow
shape, not yet rewired to call this repository's `/v1/invoices/*` endpoints
-- that rewiring is tracked as follow-up work once the Phase 1 API
(`facturx/phase1/`) is in place; `invoice_phase1_node_plan.md` remains the
authoritative blueprint for that step.

Sanitization removed, before this file was ever committed:
- a live-looking Postgres DSN with embedded credentials, sent to Reqeli on
  every request. This was **not** fixed by templating the DSN through
  environment variables -- that still ships a live DB password over HTTP on
  every call. Instead, Reqeli now receives an opaque
  `connection_ref: "tcms-primary"` and is expected to resolve its own DB
  credentials server-side; no connection string of any kind is transmitted.
- real Microsoft Outlook/Excel/Google credential references, a real
  SharePoint personal-folder URL, an Outlook mailbox deep link, and the
  n8n instance identifier
- the real organization name and two real-looking addresses (replaced with
  the repo's fictional "Unternehmen X" convention)
- hardcoded `host.docker.internal` service URLs (replaced with
  `{{ $env.* }}` expressions; required variables are documented in
  `invoice_phase1_node_plan.md`)

It also adds one behavior change beyond sanitization: the "Trigger Reqeli?"
node now additionally requires `$env.REQELI_ENABLED == "true"`, ANDed with
the existing business-rule trigger, so Reqeli is disabled by default per
`AGENTS.md`.

**Import verification:** real, not just structural. The local `n8n` CLI is
blocked in this environment (`n8n import:workflow` requires Node >=22.16;
this machine has 22.15.0), so verification instead used the official
`n8nio/n8n` Docker image (checked version 2.33.6):

```
docker run --rm -v "<path-to-file>:/data/workflow.json:ro" n8nio/n8n \
  import:workflow --input=/data/workflow.json
```

Result: `Successfully imported 1 workflow.`, confirmed listable afterward
(`list:workflow` returned `digitax-invoice-intake-phase1|DigiTax Invoice
Intake (Phase 1, sanitized)`). This confirms the file is valid,
importable n8n workflow JSON. It does not confirm the workflow runs
correctly end-to-end against live services (Outlook, Gemini, BZSt, Reqeli,
Excel) -- those credentials/URLs are placeholders by design and must be
supplied by whoever imports it. `tests/test_n8n_workflow_export.py` is a
structural regression guard (JSON validity, no re-introduced secrets, node
graph integrity, Reqeli gate present) that runs in CI; it is not a
substitute for the import test above.

## General rule

Workflow exports must contain no credentials, API keys, real invoice data,
host-specific URLs, or organization secrets. Use environment variables or n8n
credentials for all endpoints.
